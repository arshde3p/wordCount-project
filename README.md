# wordCount-project
This is the first project that I am learning in Django course and is simply to understand the basic functions and commands in Django.
This project simply counts the number of time a word appears in a text entered in the text-box.
It also teaches HTML tags like 'a' tag , 'form' tag , 'input' tag etc.
This project also taught me to use git bash and then push it onto github using command-line.
